artist1,song1,a frog is any member of a diverse and largely carnivorous group of short bodied tailless amphibians composing the order anura literally without tail in ancient greek
artist2,song2,"the oldest fossil ""proto frog"" appeared in the early triassic of madagascar but molecular clock dating suggests their origins may extend further back to the permian 265 million years ago"
artist3,song3,frogs are widely distributed ranging from the tropics to subarctic regions but the greatest concentration of species diversity is in tropical rainforests
artist4,song4,there are over 6 300 recorded species accounting for around 88% of extant amphibian species
artist5,song5,they are also one of the five most diverse vertebrate orders
artist6,song6,warty frog species tend to be called toads but the distinction between frogs and toads is informal not from taxonomy or evolutionary history
artist7,song7,frogs have glandular skin with secretions ranging from distasteful to toxic
artist8,song8,an adult frog has a stout body protruding eyes anteriorly attached tongue limbs folded underneath and no tail except in tailed frogs
artist9,song9,their skin varies in colour from well camouflaged dappled brown grey and green to vivid patterns of bright red or yellow and black to show toxicity and ward off predators
artist10,song10,frogs typically lay their eggs in water
artist11,song11,adult frogs live in fresh water and on dry land some species are adapted for living underground or in trees
artist12,song12,the eggs hatch into aquatic larvae called tadpoles that have tails and internal gills
artist13,song13,they have highly specialized rasping mouth parts suitable for herbivorous omnivorous or planktivorous diets
artist14,song14,the life cycle is completed when they metamorphose into adults
artist15,song15,a few species deposit eggs on land or bypass the tadpole stage
artist16,song16,adult frogs generally have a carnivorous diet consisting of small invertebrates but omnivorous species exist and a few feed on fruit
artist17,song17,frog skin has a rich microbiome which is important to their health
artist18,song18,frogs are extremely efficient at converting what they eat into body mass
artist19,song19,they are an important food source for predators and part of the food web dynamics of many of the world's ecosystems
artist20,song20,the skin is semi permeable making them susceptible to dehydration so they either live in moist places or have special adaptations to deal with dry habitats moose
